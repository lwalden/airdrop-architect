## Section: International Data Transfers (Add to Section 8)

Your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where our cloud infrastructure (Microsoft Azure) is located.

2. **Supplementary Measures:** Where required, we implement additional technical and organizational measures including:
   - Encryption of data in transit and at rest
   - Access controls and audit logging
   - Contractual commitments from sub-processors

3. **Adequacy Decisions:** Where available, we transfer data to countries with EU adequacy decisions.

**Microsoft Azure:**
Our primary infrastructure provider (Microsoft Azure) participates in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and maintains appropriate certifications.

You may request information about the specific safeguards applied to transfers of your data by contacting [PRIVACY_EMAIL].

**Response Timeline:**
- Initial acknowledgment: 5 business days
